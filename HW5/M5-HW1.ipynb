    "## Problem Description\n",
    "In this problem you will train decision tree and random forest models using sklearn on a real world dataset. The dataset is the *Cylinder Bands Data Set* from the UCI Machine Learning Repository: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cylinder+Bands](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Cylinder+Bands). The dataset is generated from rotogravure printers, with 39 unique features, and a binary classification label for each sample. The class is either 0, for 'band' or 1 for 'no band', where banding is an undesirable process delay that arises during the rotogravure printing process. By training ML models on this dataset, you could help identify or predict cases where these process delays are avoidable, thereby improving the efficiency of the printing. For the sake of this exercise, we only consider features 21-39 in the above link, and have removed any samples with missing values in that range. No further processing of the data is required on your behalf. The data has been partitioned into a training and testing set using an 80/20 split. Your models will be trained on just the train set, and accuracy results will be reported on both the training and testing sets.\n",
